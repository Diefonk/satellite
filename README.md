# Satellite

Satellite is an experimental music thing for [Playdate](https://play.date). It's probably mostly useful for creating backing beats and generating synth sound effects for your own Playdate game. Each project has eight synths, for which you can set waveform, note, attack, decay, sustain, release, bitcrusher amount, volume, length, and interval.
